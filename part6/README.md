# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Course steps
## redux
install redux with the command

`npm install redux`

## deep-freeze
can be used to ensure that the reducer has been correctly defined as an immutable function. 
Let's install the library as a development dependency
`npm install --save-dev deep-freeze`


## react-redux
the newest, and possibly the easiest way is using the hooks API of the react-redux library
install react-redux
`npm install react-redux`

## Redux Toolkit
Redux's configuration and state management implementation requires quite a lot of effort. For example in the reducer and action creator-related code which has somewhat repetitive boilerplate code. Redux Toolkit solves these common Redux-related problems, for example greatly simplifies the configuration of the Redux store and offers a large variety of tools to ease state management.

install the library:
`npm install @reduxjs/toolkit`

## json-server
install 
`npm install json-server --save-dev`

add the following line to the scripts part of the file package.json

```
"scripts": {
  "server": "json-server -p3001 --watch db.json",
  // ...
}
```

Now let's launch json-server with the command 
`npm run server`

## add axios to the project
`npm install axios`
