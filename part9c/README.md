# Setting up the project
We will create a project for Ilari, who loves flying small planes but has a difficult time managing his flight history. He is a coder himself, so he doesn't necessarily need a user interface, but he'd like to use some custom software with HTTP requests and retain the possibility of later adding a web-based user interface to the application.

Let's start by creating our first real project: Ilari's flight diaries. 
As usual, run 
`npm init`

and install the typescript package as a dev dependency.
`npm install typescript --save-dev`
